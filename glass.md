## Crown Glass:

I have come to the conclusion that crown glass is the most effective material to use with a light sensor as it has a low refractive index (â‰ˆ1.52) and high near-UV transmission.

#### When compared to another common low-dispersion glass in a study (flint glass,) crown glass outperformed:

With crown glasses' lower refractive index and higher Abbe number it will be much more effective at combatting the reflection of light in a light sensor. Although fused quartz is also effective at preventing the reflection of light in a light sensor, crown glass is much more inexpensive in comparison, making it still the best material to use.
